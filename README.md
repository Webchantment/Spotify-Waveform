STOP! This userscript requires a Spotify API key to work.

Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Goto: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications

2. Log in with your Spotify account.

3. Click on "Create An App", pick an "App name" and "App description" of your choice and click "Create".

4. After creation, you'll see your "Client ID" and you can click on "Show Client Secret" to unhide your "Client Secret".

5. In the SETTINGS section of the userscript, replace the "myClientID" and "myClientSecret" with your "Client ID" and "Client Secret". Save the userscript and reload the webpage.

Use Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey to install.
